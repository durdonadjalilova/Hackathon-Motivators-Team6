# Welcome to your Inspirational Weather App!

This app was created to help people acheive a better mental state.
On the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, we know there has been loss, sickness, and struggle.
All of these can take a heavy toll on anyone's mental state.

We can sometime forget that we can worry about how we're doing as much as we ask others how they are.

What you'll find in this application is a Weather application that provides an affirmation you can repeat to yourself, preferably out loud and in a mirror, only asking for your name and zip code.

Take care and thank you for visiting!
